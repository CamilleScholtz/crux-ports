Make sure to run the pre-install, and to fix you music directory
in /ect/mpd.conf.

Optional dependencies enrich mpd's features, and we leave choices
for end users:
To enable FLAC support, append "--enable-flac" option;
To enable sndio plugin, append "--enable-sndio" option;
To enable libiso9660 archive plugin, append "--enable-iso9660" option.
